    She uses this to make coffee at any time of the day and makes extra in the mornings if she feels the day will be overly tiring. This coffee-making machine has lasted quite some time and considering the amount of times Joyce accidentally burns the bottom of the metal, its not going anywhere anytime soon. It is indestructible and overtime, has become a necessity.

    This peculiar piece of decoration has been in her family for a long time and was passed down to her from her grandma when she first moved in. Although theres not much space in the apartment for this lamp and the only person who truly likes it is Joyce, it does not move from its permanent place in the living room next to the couch. It becomes helpful when the light of day begins to dim and she wants the apartment to feel warmer.

    When her daily life becomes exhausting and she begins to feel deprived of the happiness she used to feel before, Joyce writes. It’s as if her note-taking and emotional pieces of writing are never ending. Plotting everything down makes her feel better and more content with the fact that she has a place to store all of her overwhelming thoughts other than in her mind.

    This is Oliver’s favorite mouse toy and it may be time for a new one. It has definitely seen better days but Steve refuses to throw it out as Oliver cant really sleep without it wrapped between his paws. It was one of the first toys Steve bought Oliver when he realized the “needy apartment cat” favored his humble abode and became a resident of apartment 306 along with him.

    Gifted by his granddaughter and only used for black coffee in the morning, Steve’s favorite mug is a prominent part of his kitchen. Surprisingly enough, this mug is yet to be chipped.

    Steve’s old record player broke during his move to Miami and couldn’t find one he genuinely liked until he found this one. You can hear his vinyl records from across the hallway when he begins to play them around the afternoon. At times, he just sits in absolute peace watching the player’s needle go within each groove of the record; going in circles until the side reaches the end.
