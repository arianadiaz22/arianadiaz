<p class=ownerparagraphs id="paragraph3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oyce has lived in Miami her entire life and hasn’t really thought of where else she would go if it wasn’t for here. Growing up around people she felt comfortable with, she is not quite ready to leave the community she has become a part of. She has everything she needs, but doesn’t spend enough time on herself to think about the things she wants. At the moment, she’s attending an art school in Downtown and 25th for drawing and stays later hours to be left completely alone in the classroom, it helps her focus and distract from the overwhelming noise of the people around her. Working at a print shop near Biscayne, her work can oftentimes feel very overwhelming and isolated. Not many customers pass by and she closes the shop alone in the evening. Joyce’s parents do not live very far from her apartment, which she made sure of in case they needed her one day. Although she does not maintain the best relationship with them, she feels it's necessary they know she is close by.

<p class=ownerparagraphs id="paragraph4"><br clear="left">Old man Steve is really one of the only people Joyce truly spends time with, possibly because he reminds her of her grandfather whom she was close to, who passed away a couple of years prior to her moving out of her childhood home. Joyce surrounds herself with homely objects in the apartment and knocks on Steve’s door twice when she arrives from work. She noticed that out of all the things she cooks for the both of them, he likes microwavable mac and cheese the most. As she tries to not take that fact as an insult, it ends up being what they eat on late nights while they sit on the old couch to watch reruns of “George Lopez” and “Golden Girls”. As the day begins to darken, Joyce feels at peace living in Apartment 305, knowing she lives in a home she feels safe in.
