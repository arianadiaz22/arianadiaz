<p class=oms id="paragraph1">Steve moved to Miami in the 80’s when he decided to leave his home in Brooklyn, New York. He thinks of Miami and Downtown as his second home, as a place where he feels safe. Although sometimes lonely, Steve spends time with Joyce, the next door neighbor, on the weekdays after she gets off of work at 7. He shuffles playing cards and leaves them on the kitchen counter a couple of hours prior, waiting for her to get home and knock on his door to play. While he often seems annoyed and accuses her of cheating for winning the game more than once, he holds a kind of endearment for Joyce. When the rest of his family is too occupied with other matters to come visit, Joyce is there to take care of him and clean up around the apartment, which gets dusty after a while, especially when he forgets where he placed the broom. He is accompanied by his cat Oliver, seeming to be about the only thing he loves, apart from his pristine collection of vintage records that he keeps away from the sunlight. 
</p>

<p class=oms id="paragraph2"><br clear="left">If not playing cards with Joyce or watching the TV waiting for “Golden Girls” to play at midnight, Steve isn't too fond of partaking in many activities. He says attempting to be interested in the conversation he has with others outside of the building is draining and that it “makes him older than he already is”. Perhaps his lack of social interaction is why he is constantly grumpy and has a constant indistinguishable frown. However, if able to get past the sarcastic and unnecessary remarks, old man Steve is dependable and holds those whom he loves, Oliver and only Oliver, as close to his heart as possible.
